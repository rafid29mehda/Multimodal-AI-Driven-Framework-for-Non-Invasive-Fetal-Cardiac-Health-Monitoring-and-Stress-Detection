### Title
**A Multimodal AI-Driven Framework for Non-Invasive Fetal Cardiac Health Monitoring and Stress Detection**

---

### Health Issues Addressed
The framework tackles critical challenges in fetal cardiac monitoring:
1. **Noisy Fetal ECG Signals**: Fetal ECG (fECG) is often obscured by maternal ECG and noise, complicating accurate monitoring.
2. **Early Detection of Arrhythmias**: Fetal arrhythmias (e.g., premature atrial contractions, bradycardia) are hard to detect early, yet critical for timely interventions.
3. **Accurate Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) Estimation**: Single-modal methods (ECG or Doppler) can be unreliable, impacting fetal well-being assessments.
4. **Cardiac Anomaly Detection**: Structural and conduction anomalies require early, non-invasive screening to improve outcomes.
5. **Fetal Stress Detection**: Hypoxia-induced stress manifests subtly in ECG and Doppler, necessitating sensitive detection methods.
6. **Clinical Trust in AI**: Clinicians need interpretable AI tools to adopt automated fetal cardiac assessments.

### Methodology
The methodology integrates the individual approaches into a cohesive pipeline, leveraging multimodal data (27-channel fECG, pulse wave Doppler (PWD), maternal respiration) and combining signal processing, sensor fusion, machine learning, and explainable AI. The framework consists of five interconnected modules, each building on the others to ensure depth and robustness.

#### 1. Fetal ECG Extraction and Denoising
**Objective**: Extract clean fECG signals from noisy 27-channel electrophysiological data.
- **Data**: 27-channel fECG, PWD signals, maternal respiration.
- **Approach**:
  - Apply **blind source separation** using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to isolate fECG from maternal ECG and noise (inspired by Sulas et al., 2019).
  - Use adaptive filtering (e.g., QR decomposition-based Recursive Least Squares, QRD-RLS) to refine fECG extraction, leveraging maternal ECG as a reference.
  - Enhance signal quality with **wavelet-based denoising** (Baldazzi et al., 2020) to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
  - Validate extracted fECG using PWD-derived envelopes (via provided Matlab tools) as a ground truth for fetal heart activity.
- **Output**: Clean fECG signals with high SNR, suitable for downstream analysis.

#### 2. Multimodal Feature Extraction
**Objective**: Derive comprehensive features from fECG, PWD, and maternal signals to capture fetal cardiac and stress-related patterns.
- **Data**: Clean fECG, PWD, maternal respiration.
- **Approach**:
  - **fECG Features**: Extract RR intervals, P-wave morphology, heart rate variability (HRV), and QRS complex characteristics using signal processing techniques.
  - **PWD Features**: Compute atrioventricular time intervals, Doppler envelope changes, and peak velocities using Matlab-based envelope extraction.
  - **Maternal Features**: Analyze respiration patterns to account for maternal-fetal interactions affecting stress or cardiac signals.
  - **Synchronization**: Align fECG and PWD signals temporally to ensure feature consistency across modalities.
- **Output**: A rich feature set capturing cardiac (arrhythmias, anomalies) and stress-related (HRV, Doppler changes) patterns.

#### 3. Multimodal Sensor Fusion and FHR Estimation
**Objective**: Combine fECG and PWD for accurate and robust fetal heart rate (FHR) estimation.
- **Data**: Clean fECG, PWD signals, extracted features.
- **Approach**:
  - Use **Kalman filtering** to fuse fECG and PWD signals, accounting for temporal dynamics and noise uncertainties.
  - Alternatively, train a **multimodal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to integrate fECG and PWD data, learning optimal weights for FHR estimation.
  - Compare fused FHR estimates with single-modality estimates (ECG-only, Doppler-only) to quantify improvement.
  - Validate against clinical annotations (provided ground truth) to assess accuracy, focusing on early pregnancy data.
- **Output**: Reliable FHR estimates with reduced errors compared to single-modal methods.

#### 4. Machine Learning for Arrhythmia, Anomaly, and Stress Detection
**Objective**: Develop a unified machine learning model to detect arrhythmias, cardiac anomalies, and fetal stress.
- **Data**: Multimodal features (fECG, PWD, maternal respiration), clinical annotations, echocardiography reports.
- **Approach**:
  - **Model Architecture**: Train a **hybrid CNN-LSTM network** to capture spatial (ECG morphology) and temporal (HRV, Doppler changes) patterns.
    - CNN layers process fECG and PWD waveforms for feature extraction.
    - LSTM layers model temporal dependencies for arrhythmia and stress detection.
  - **Tasks**:
    - **Arrhythmia Detection**: Classify normal vs. arrhythmic beats (e.g., premature atrial contractions, bradycardia) using RR intervals and P-wave features.
    - **Anomaly Detection**: Identify structural or conduction anomalies (e.g., ventricular septal defects) using fECG and PWD features, validated against echocardiography.
    - **Stress Detection**: Detect fetal stress (e.g., hypoxia) by analyzing HRV, Doppler envelope changes, and maternal respiration patterns.
  - **Training**:
    - Use cross-validation to ensure generalizability.
    - Incorporate early pregnancy data to focus on early detection.
    - Balance classes using techniques like SMOTE to handle rare anomalies or stress events.
  - **Validation**: Compare model performance (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) with clinical methods, using provided annotations and PWD-derived ground truth.
- **Output**: A multi-task model for simultaneous arrhythmia, anomaly, and stress detection.

#### 5. Explainable AI for Clinical Interpretability
**Objective**: Enhance clinician trust by providing interpretable AI predictions.
- **Data**: Model predictions, multimodal features, clinical annotations.
- **Approach**:
  - Apply **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to quantify the contribution of each feature (e.g., RR intervals, PWD velocities) to predictions.
  - Use **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to generate visual explanations of individual predictions, highlighting key ECG or Doppler patterns.
  - Validate interpretability through **clinical expert reviews**, ensuring explanations align with medical knowledge.
  - Develop a user-friendly **dashboard** to display fECG waveforms, PWD envelopes, FHR estimates, model predictions, and SHAP/LIME explanations.
- **Output**: Interpretable predictions with clear feature contributions, facilitating clinical adoption.
